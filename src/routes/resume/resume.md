> I'm a Fullstack Developer and Product Designer based in Boulder, CO. I specialize in crafting seamless user experiences all the way from Figma prototype to code. I'm fluent in Go, TypeScript and Dart, and am comfortable in many frontend languages ranging from React and Svelte for the web to Flutter or Native Development for mobile. I am also very comfortable in writing highly performant backends in Go or Python. While I enjoy navigating the entire tech stack, I'm particularly passionate about bridging the gap between design and development.
